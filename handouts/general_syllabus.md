## Grading Details

Homework consist of all coding assignments, quizzes, or anything that is not considered a test. A semester long group or individual project is usually assigned at the second week of class. The instructor will work on some parts in class to assist in the creation of the semester project students will be responsible for the other half. Tests and the final exam consists of both a multiple choice portion pulled directly from the resources and a hands on portion covering material taught in class. Itâ€™s important that you keep up on assignments or you will have trouble with the tests.

## Due Dates

Due dates are set in place for a purpose. Missing a due date means those assignments missed will receive a zero in the grade book. Assignments turned in after the due date will be graded but will not be entered in the grade book if they are received after midnight on the last day of class. The normal due date is a week from when originally assigned.

## Absences and Tardiness

Each student must commit himself/herself to attend each and every class and being on time.  If a student does in fact miss a class, then, he/she is responsible for obtaining missed information from his/her classmates or instructor. This is a class whereby a student can get behind real quick if attendance is not a priority. It is the student's responsibility to drop the course if necessary according to the procedures in the college catalog. The instructor will not drop the student under any circumstances.

## Student Conduct In Class Policy

Any acts of classroom disruption that go beyond the normal rights of students to question and discuss with instructors the educational process relative to subject content will not be tolerated, in accordance with the Academic Code of Conduct described in the Northwest Vista College Catalog.  Absolutely no drinks or snacks near any computing equipment.

## Electronic Devices In Class Policy

All cell phones, pagers, or other electronic devices must be set to silent or vibrate. Calculators and computers are prohibited during examinations and quizzes, unless specified. Reasonable laptop-size computers may be used in lecture for the purpose of taking notes.

## Examination Policy

No make-up exams will be allowed without prior arrangements being made. Make-up exams must be taken when scheduled.
