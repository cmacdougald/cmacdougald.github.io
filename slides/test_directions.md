## Post Test

* Don’t panic about the auto grading and your initial grade I still have to grade the short answer/essay/programming parts.
* Everything is curved so RELAX it’s normal for this first test to be harder than expected.
* I will have them all graded by next class period. If you really need it graded sooner for whatever reason let me know.
* We will review over the test next class and continue the lessons as planned.
